    <h1>Hi, I'm Mohammad.</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a
	specialization in Information. I have a firm foundation in objected-oriented programming languages from Python to Java.
	I look to write efficient and elegant code and am always looking for ways to improve and learn new things. I'm currently
	looking for a Software Engineering position where I can have plently of opportunities to grow with those who are as excited
	about teaching as I am with learning.
	</p>
	<p>
	My recent interests have led me to learn more about the front-end side of programming, such as using HTML/CSS. In fact,
	this website is my current project! It provides me with a playground to test and cement my new knowledge along with allowing
	any who happen upon it to get a better idea of who I am. I hope you enjoy your stay.
